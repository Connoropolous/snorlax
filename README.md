Snorlax is an opinionated, flexible, and well-RESTed gem for building Rails APIs. It's designed to Do The Right Thingâ„¢ by default, but allow you to customize where necessary.

It's been extracted from [Loomio](www.github.com/loomio/loomio).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snorlax'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snorlax

## Usage

There are two primary ways to use Snorlax. The easier way is to inherit from it:

```
class MyController < Snorlax::Base
end
```

But, if you're already inheriting from something else, Snorlax makes it easy to simply apply itself to your controller without being a parent, by calling `snorlax_used_rest!` like so:

```
class MyController < SomeOtherController
  snorlax_used_rest!
end
```

Once you've got it installed, you're good to go!

#### Some things to know about Snorlax:

###### Side loading

Snorlax is designed to provide a set of flexible API endpoints for client side consumption. It uses side loading, which means that all of the records returned are unnested and easily available for consumption.

###### The show action

By default, Snorlax will fetch the requested model by `id` using the `ActiveModel::Base.find` method. To override this behaviour, you may override the `load_resource` method in your controller.

NB: This would be a great place to ensure that the current user is allowed to view the requested resource.

###### The index action

Snorlax DEMANDS that you define two separate methods for the index action to work properly:
- `public_records` - records which are available publicly (ie, they can be viewed even if current_user is nil)
- `visible_recordss` - records which the current user is allowed to access.

```
class StaryusController < Snorlax::Base
  def public_records
    Staryu.visible_to_public
  end

  def visible_records
    current_user.staryus
  end
end
```
If these are the same, you may override the `accessible_records` method instead

```
class StarmiesController < Snorlax::Base
  def accessible_records
    Starmie.all
  end
end
```

###### Paging the index action

A Snorlax controller can accept `from` and `per` parameters for paging. For example,

```
/api/vi/psyducks?from=0&per=100
```

will return the first 100 psyducks within the acccessible records.

If no `from` or `per` params are provided, Snorlax will default to the first 50 records. (from = 0, per = 50)

You can override the default page size by overriding the `default_page_size` method.

```
class WobbuffetsController < Snorlax::Base
  def default_page_size
    25
  end
end
```

###### Timeframing the index action

A Snorlax controller can accept `since` and `until` parameters for timeframing. The date it looks for defaults to `created_at`. For example,

```
/api/v1/charmanders?since=11-11-2011&until=12-12-2012
```

will return charmanders which were created between Nov 11, 2011, and Dec 12, 2012.

You can override the datetime column the query looks at by passing the `timeframe_for` option. For example,

```
/api/v1/charmeleons?since=11-11-2011&until=12-12-2012&timeframe_for=evolved_at
```

will return charmeleons which evolved between Nov 11, 2011, and Dec 12, 2012

Since and until can be in any format that `Date.parse` will accept.

###### Custom filtering on the index action

Snorlax also provides a dead simple way to provide your own filters, in addition to and in combination with the ones provided.
You can do this by passing a block to the `instantiate_collection` method in your controller action. For example,

```
class ChanseysController < Snorlax::Base
  def sleeping
    instantiate_collection { |collection| collection.where(sleeping: true) }
    respond_with_collection
  end
end
```

Will return all sleeping Chanseys. (This can be combined with timeframing and paginating as well.)
(NB: this filtering happens before the collection is paginated or timeframed, so it's a good opportunity to add additional filters
or apply an order to your records. Or both!)

TODO
  - Customizing the serializer options
- Expand on create / update action
  - create_action, update_action overriding
  - respond_with_resource
- Expand on destroy action [destroy_action]
  - destroy_action overriding
- Explain the respond_with_errors behaviour
