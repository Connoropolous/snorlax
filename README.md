Snorlax is an opinionated, flexible, and well-RESTed gem for building Rails APIs. It's designed to Do The Right Thingâ„¢ by default, but allow you to customize where necessary.

It's been extracted from [Loomio](www.github.com/loomio/loomio).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snorlax'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snorlax

## Usage

There are two primary ways to use Snorlax. The easier way is to inherit from it:

```
class MyController < Snorlax::Base
end
```

But, if you're already inheriting from something else, Snorlax makes it easy to simply apply itself to your controller without being a parent, by calling `snorlax_used_rest!` like so:

```
class MyController < SomeOtherController
  snorlax_used_rest!
end
```

Once you've got it installed, you're good to go!
